# ArtMart

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/license/abbeydoyle/artmart?color=pink&style=plastic)

An online shop for an artist's work and also where freelance and upcoming artists showcasing their art for consumer‚Äôs to view and purchase.

## Description

This project implements the MERN stack to create an art print ecommerce website. React was used to render the front end with TailwindCSS styling, the server  created with GraphQL, Express.js, and Node.js, and the database implemented with MongoDB and Mongoose ODM. Cloudinary was used to host images and Stripe was implemented as a payment platform. Finally, the application was deployed using Heroku. Through mutations and queries, an online shopper can browse art, add things to their own cart while logged in, and checkout with Stripe. All of these features are saved to a user's profile and available upon later login. 

This project allowed five contributors to in turn test the pair programming model, work in branches, and merge each individual coding style into the larger collaboration project. Further, it solidified the working knowledge of node, it's dependencies, Tailwind CSS styling, and introduced the Stripe payment platform.

## UserStory

As an art fan<br>
I want to have a website where I can find unique prints from artists<br>
So THAT I can purchase them and display them in my home.<br>

WHEN I first open the app <br>
THEN I see the landing page of art available to purchase<br>
WHEN I view the navbar while not signed in<br>
THEN I see links to login/signup and prints pages<br>
WHEN I view the navbar while signed in<br>
THEN I see links to prints and my cart pages<br>
WHEN I click the login button<br>
THEN I am redirected to a login page with an option to sign up<br>
WHEN I click the prints page<br>
THEN I am redirected to a card portfolio of prints available to purchase<br>
WHEN I click the profile page<br>
THEN I am redirected to a page with my shipping address, email, password, wishlist, and past orders<br>
WHEN I click the view cart page<br>
THEN I see all prints in my cart with thumbnail images, artist info, quantity, individual prices, and a subtotal<br>
WHEN I hit the ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù button while signed in<br>
THEN I am redirected to my cart page where that item is added<br>
WHEN I attempt to checkout without being signed in<br>
THEN I am redirected to log in<br>
